# spring-mvc-app

### Introduction
Welcome to my first project using Spring MVC! This project, spring-mvc-app, represents my initial steps into the world of Spring Framework, where I have been exploring fundamental concepts like dependency injection, MVC patterns, controllers, and request handling. The application is a simple yet robust example of a Java web application built with Spring, demonstrating my foundational knowledge and eagerness to learn more about backend development with Java.

### Project Overview
spring-mvc-app is designed as a starting point for learning Spring MVC architecture. It includes essential components such as:
- **Controllers**: Manages HTTP requests and directs them to the appropriate view or service.
- **Service Layer**: Encapsulates business logic (future implementation).
- **Thymeleaf Views**: Renders the views using Thymeleaf templates for a dynamic user interface.
- **JSP**: Basic JSP pages are used to demonstrate request handling and response generation.

The main functionalities of the project include:
1. Basic HTTP request handling.
2. Parameterized endpoints to test dynamic responses.
3. Simple arithmetic operations via a calculator controller, showcasing request parameters and response rendering.

### Technologies Used
- **Java** (JDK 17): Project is built on Java 17, utilizing recent language features like the enhanced `switch` expressions.
- **Spring Core**: For dependency injection and core container functionality.
- **Spring MVC**: To handle web requests, routes, and integrate views.
- **Thymeleaf**: A modern server-side Java template engine for rendering HTML.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and project build.
- **JUnit**: Basic tests (future implementation) for unit testing the components.
- **Apache Tomcat 11**: The embedded server for running the application.

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
